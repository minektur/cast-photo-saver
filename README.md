photo screen saver for chromecast


##fixme

* stuff about dev account
* stuff about dev app setup
* stuff about local machine setup
* performance/CSS limitations
  * split work up
    - load-offscreen early
    - transition in way after loading?
  * opacity changes instead?
  * javascript instead of css?
  * transcode images to lower res on the fly
  * load pre-rendered html5 snippets?
  * turn the whole thing into hardware accelerated stream?
  * 3d transforms?
  * requestanimationframe magic on my own?
  

## still left
  * autostart of cast app (startme integration)
  * daemonization
  * config file/command line options
  * maybe? move to control over cast channel
  * use pychromecast to auto-detect device by name
